"""
Agent Kai API Routes — Modular Package

This package organizes Kai routes into logical modules:
- chat.py: Conversational chat endpoint with auto-learning
- portfolio.py: Portfolio import and analysis
- plaid.py: Read-only brokerage connectivity, OAuth resume, refresh, and source selection
- analyze.py: Non-streaming analysis endpoint
- stream.py: SSE streaming analysis endpoint
- decisions.py: Decision history (reads from domain_summaries; legacy CRUD returns 410)
- consent.py: Kai-specific consent grants
- support.py: Profile support and bug-report messaging via Gmail API

All sub-routers are aggregated into `kai_router` for backward compatibility.
