# Professional Verification Policy

## Purpose

Define the hard-gate rules for regulated professional access before investor data, discovery, or client-linking workflows become available.

## Official Registry Rules

1. Treat SEC/IAPD disclosure records as the authoritative advisory admission control.
2. Treat broker verification as a separate capability with its own official verification lane.
3. Use public BrokerCheck fallback only for evidence gathering when official broker verification is not configured; it must not activate live broker capability.
4. Keep verification fail-closed in production when a terminal advisory decision cannot be produced.

## Capability State Model

1. `draft`
2. `submitted`
3. `verified`
4. `active`
5. `rejected`
6. `bypassed`

## Gate Rules

1. `draft` and `submitted` cannot create investor-data access requests.
2. `verified`, `active`, and `bypassed` can create investor-data access requests only for the advisory lane.
3. `rejected` must resubmit and pass verification.
4. Discoverability is not an admission-control shortcut; it can be enabled only after the advisory lane reaches a trusted state.
5. Brokerage evidence gathered from public fallback must never unlock live brokerage capability.

## Verification Data Contract

1. `individual_legal_name`
2. `individual_crd`
3. `advisory_firm_legal_name`
4. `advisory_firm_iapd_number`
5. `broker_firm_legal_name`
6. `broker_firm_crd`
7. `advisory_status`
8. `brokerage_status`
9. `verification_checked_at`
10. `verification_expires_at`

## Freshness and Runtime Controls

1. Cache successful advisory and broker verification responses with TTL.
2. Re-verify on identity edits that affect names, CRD, or firm identifiers.
3. Re-verify after TTL expiry.
4. In production, startup must fail if advisory bypass is enabled or IAPD provider config is missing.
5. In non-production, bypassed results must be explicitly labeled as bypassed and auditable.
