Use this as the entrypoint for CI, docs governance, delivery, and environment operations.
One-time rollout notes belong in PRs, issues, or git history, not in the active operations surface.

## Codex OS

Use the root CLI for agent-first onboarding and deterministic workflow routing:

- `./bin/hushh codex onboard`
- `./bin/hushh codex list-workflows`
- `./bin/hushh codex route-task <workflow-id>`
- `./bin/hushh codex impact <workflow-id> [--path <repo-path>]`
- `./bin/hushh codex ci-status [--watch]`
- `./bin/hushh codex maintenance <daily|weekly|monthly>`
- `./bin/hushh codex audit`

## Codex skills

Top-level owner skills:

- `.codex/skills/repo-context/`: broad repository orientation, cross-domain routing, and full-repo coverage mapping.
- `.codex/skills/frontend/`: broad frontend intake across routes, components, services, and verification ownership.
- `.codex/skills/mobile-native/`: iOS, Android, Capacitor plugin, and mobile parity intake.
- `.codex/skills/backend/`: backend runtime, route, service, agent, and package-surface intake.
- `.codex/skills/security-audit/`: IAM, consent, trust, vault, PKM, streaming, and verification/audit intake.
- `.codex/skills/docs-governance/`: documentation homes, consolidation, maps, and docs verification policy.
- `.codex/skills/repo-operations/`: CI/CD, branch protection, deploys, env parity, and runtime operations.
- `.codex/skills/planning-board/`: `Hushh Engineering Core` board workflows only.
- `.codex/skills/future-planner/`: future-state roadmap planning, R&D filtering, and promotion-boundary decisions.
- `.codex/skills/comms-community/`: public/community explanation workflows.
- `.codex/skills/codex-skill-authoring/`: repo-local skill creation, retrofit, linting, scaffolding, and taxonomy maintenance.

Specialist spoke skills live under the same tree and should be used after the correct owner skill or `repo-context` has narrowed the request.
Workflow packs under `.codex/workflows/` are the canonical recurring task surface for routing and onboarding.
Scheduled Codex maintenance workflows are the canonical time-driven maintenance surface for workflow drift, security backlog visibility, and the rolling `Codex Maintenance Radar` issue.
Use `ci-watch-and-heal` plus `./bin/hushh codex ci-status` when the task depends on live PR checks or GitHub Actions state.
