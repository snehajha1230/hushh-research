# Branch Governance

This repo runs on three branch lanes:

| Branch | Purpose | Default policy |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Team integration branch | Every feature PR targets `main` |
| `deploy_uat` | UAT release lane | Open to approved developers, must contain latest `main` |
| `deploy` | Production release lane | Release-only branch, must contain latest `main` |

## Working Rules

1. Start all development branches from `main`.
2. Merge all feature/fix/docs work back into `main`.
3. Never develop directly on `deploy` or `deploy_uat`.
4. Promote by merging or fast-forwarding the latest `main` into:
   - `deploy_uat` for UAT rollout
   - `deploy` for production release preparation
5. A release branch must contain the latest `origin/main` before deployment.

## Deployment Lanes

### `deploy_uat`

1. Auto-deploys to UAT on push.
2. Manual dispatch is also allowed.
3. No reviewer gate is required in the workflow itself.
4. Workflow preflight fails if `deploy_uat` does not contain the latest `origin/main`.

### `deploy`

1. Does not auto-deploy production.
2. Production deploy is manual only through `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`.
3. The workflow is valid only when dispatched from the `deploy` branch.
4. Workflow preflight fails if `deploy` does not contain the latest `origin/main`.

## GitHub Admin Checklist

### `main`

1. Require pull requests before merge.
2. Require the `CI Status Gate` and `Main Freshness Gate` status checks.
3. Block force-pushes.
4. Block branch deletion.
5. Decide explicitly whether admins can bypass branch protection.

Current operating note:

- if `enforce_admins=false`, admins can still push directly even when `main` is protected
- verify the live setting with `./scripts/ci/verify-main-branch-protection.sh`

### `deploy`

1. Protect the branch.
2. Restrict who can push or merge.
3. Treat it as release-only.
4. Use it only after syncing from `main`.

### `deploy_uat`

1. Protect the branch.
2. Allow approved developers to push.
3. Keep it synced from `main` before rollout.

## Production Approval Environments

The production workflow uses two GitHub environment names:

| Environment | Intended use |
|---|---|
| `production-approval` | Non-owner deploys, configure required reviewers |
| `production-owner-bypass` | Owner-triggered deploys, no reviewer gate |

Default owner assumption in the workflow:

- `kushaltrivedi`

If ownership changes, update `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` and the environment reviewers together.
