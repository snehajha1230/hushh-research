# Observability Event Matrix

## Visual Context

Canonical visual owner: [Observability Architecture Map](./observability-architecture-map.md). Use that map for topology and reporting boundaries; this page is the event taxonomy and emitter map beneath it.

This matrix documents the maintained Kai observability contract:

1. what each event means
2. which params are required
3. where it is emitted
4. where it is consumed
5. how it is verified

## Declared but Not Currently Emitted

These events are declared in the schema, but there is no current live emitter in the web app codebase.

| Event | Current status | Next action before dashboard use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `persona_switched` | declared only | add emitter or remove from contract |
| `marketplace_profile_viewed` | declared only | add emitter or remove from contract |
| `ria_request_blocked_policy` | declared only | add emitter or remove from contract |
| `mcp_ria_read_tool_called` | declared only | add emitter or remove from contract |

Do not build dashboard assumptions on declared-only events.
