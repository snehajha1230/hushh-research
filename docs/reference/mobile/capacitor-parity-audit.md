# Capacitor Parity Audit

This is the release-gate contract for calling iOS/Android parity complete.

## Source Of Truth

- Route/runtime manifest: `hushh-webapp/route-contracts.json`
- Mobile parity registry: `hushh-webapp/mobile-parity-registry.json`
- Route verifier: `hushh-webapp/scripts/verify-route-contracts.cjs`
- Capacitor route verifier: `hushh-webapp/scripts/verify-capacitor-routes.cjs`
- Browser/native compatibility verifier: `hushh-webapp/scripts/verify-native-browser-compat.cjs`
- Full audit lane: `hushh-webapp/scripts/verify-capacitor-audit.cjs`

## Required Local Command

```bash
cd hushh-webapp
npm run verify:capacitor:audit
```

The audit must pass as one lane, not as a hand-waved collection of partial checks.

## Route Classification Policy

Every visible page in `pageContracts[]` must be classified in `mobile-parity-registry.json` as one of:

- native-supported and required
- intentionally web-only and explicitly exempt

Current policy keeps the full visible app surface in scope, including:

- product routes
- `/developers`
- public/auth content routes
- visible labs routes

## Browser API Policy

Route-facing code must not directly own browser-only APIs when a shared wrapper should exist.

Current shared wrappers:

- clipboard: `hushh-webapp/lib/utils/clipboard.ts`
- navigation mutations / external open: `hushh-webapp/lib/utils/browser-navigation.ts`
- local/session storage access: `hushh-webapp/lib/utils/session-storage.ts`
- download/export: `hushh-webapp/lib/utils/native-download.ts`

Direct usage is allowed only in:

- the wrapper files above
- explicitly exempt web-only plugin implementations
- documented accepted exceptions in `mobile-parity-registry.json`

## Accepted Exceptions

Current accepted parity exceptions are:

1. Android native passkey PRF is still pending. iOS PRF is implemented; Android uses biometric/passphrase fallback.
2. Some vault preference flows remain cloud-backed by design. `storePreferencesToCloud()` is the canonical native-safe write path, and `deletePreferences()` is not parity-complete in the web fallback.

If a new exception is needed, document it in `mobile-parity-registry.json` and `docs/guides/mobile.md` in the same change.

## Native Project Sanity

Parity is not complete until both projects still load structurally:

- iOS: `xcodebuild -list -project ios/App/App.xcodeproj`
- Android: `./gradlew tasks --all`

## Release Standard

Treat docs/runtime drift as a blocker. A route, native contract, or browser-sensitive flow is not parity-ready if the docs and audit registry do not describe it correctly.
