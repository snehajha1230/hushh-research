# Frontend Pattern Catalog


## Visual Context

Canonical visual owner: [Quality and Design System Index](README.md). Use that map for the top-down system view; this page is the narrower detail beneath it.

## Pattern: Stock Primitive First
Use when you need baseline UI controls.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import {
  Tabs,
  TabsList,
  TabsTrigger,
  TabsContent,
} from "@/components/ui/tabs";
import { Dialog, DialogContent } from "@/components/ui/dialog";
```

## Pattern: Morphy CTA Extension
Use when an action needs upgraded CTA behavior (ripple, premium treatment).

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/lib/morphy-ux/button";

<Button variant="blue-gradient" effect="fill" showRipple>
  Continue
</Button>
```

## Pattern: Morphy Surface Primitive
Use when defining or extending the shared card system itself.

```tsx
import { SurfaceCard, SurfaceInset } from "@/lib/morphy-ux/surfaces";

<SurfaceCard>
  ...
</SurfaceCard>
```

Rules:
1. Primitive surface tokens and shell classes live in `lib/morphy-ux/*`.
2. The analysis-datatable surface treatment is the baseline for shared card chrome.
3. Do not recreate a parallel shared card primitive in `components/app-ui/*` or feature folders.

## Pattern: App Semantic Surface
Use when a route needs a shared semantic wrapper built on Morphy primitives.

```tsx
import { SurfaceCard, SurfaceInset } from "@/components/app-ui/surfaces";
```

Rules:
1. `components/app-ui/surfaces.tsx` is the semantic bridge, not a second primitive system.
2. Feature folders consume these surfaces; they do not fork them.

## Pattern: Shared Segmented Tabs
Use the shared segmented control for app-facing rounded tab groups.

```tsx
import { SegmentedTabs } from "@/lib/morphy-ux/ui";
```

Rules:
1. `@/components/ui/tabs` remains the low-level Radix/shadcn semantic primitive.
2. `@/lib/morphy-ux/ui/segmented-tabs` is the canonical app-facing segmented visual system.
3. Route files should not fork their own segmented shell styling.

## Pattern: App Shell Action Surface
Use the shared shell surface for top-bar actions so ripple, contrast, badges, and focus treatment stay consistent.

```tsx
import { ShellActionSurface } from "@/components/app-ui/shell-action-surface";
```

Rules:
1. Back, bell, shield, and persona pill interactions all use the same shell surface contract.
2. Dropdown triggers should accept a wrapper or render-trigger path, not just a class string, when ripple ownership is required.

## Pattern: Nested Route Back Navigation
Use the shared top-bar back affordance for signed-in subroutes that drill below a parent workspace.

Rules:
1. Nested routes should navigate back through the top shell, not through feature-local inline buttons.
2. Preserve the parent workspace context in the back target, including route params or query state when that context is part of the flow.
3. Only use inline back controls when the surface is outside the normal shell, such as a modal, sheet, or fullscreen flow.
4. Query-state workspaces such as `/profile?panel=...` still count as nested navigation and must resolve their back affordance through the shared top bar.

## Pattern: Standard Route Header Leading
Use `PageHeader icon={...}` for normal signed-in route headers.

Rules:
1. The `icon` slot is the default route-header leading treatment.
2. Do not recreate custom route-header icon wells with `leading`.
3. Reserve `leading` for semantic non-icon content such as badges, avatars, or endpoint method pills.
4. Match `PageHeader accent` to the actual surface identity, not the broader product area.
5. When a primary route header has both actions and descriptive copy, prefer the standard 3-row mobile layout instead of forcing actions inline.

## Pattern: Primary Read Sections
Use one primary summary card for the main read in analysis/workspace sections.

Rules:
1. Do not add adjacent mini-summary cards that restate the same status, count, or framing.
2. Secondary cards should only exist when they introduce new evidence, alternate reads, or drill-down actions.
3. Counts such as focus-block totals or secondary-read totals should usually sit as small badges inside the main card, not as separate cards.

## Pattern: Inspectable Evidence
Use when a surface exposes counts, grouped objects, leaders/laggards, tracked names, or any other summary that implies underlying data.

Rules:
1. If the UI says `44 names`, the detail state should expose the 44 names cleanly.
2. Prefer the component density that preserves meaning:
   - badges for short symbol or keyword sets
   - rows for richer objects with context
   - grouped semantic sections when the data needs explanation
3. Avoid arbitrary line-broken symbol dumps or comma-group text walls with no framing.
4. The detail state must answer why the count matters, not just repeat the count in prose.
5. Do not open a modal or detail card unless it adds new inspectable evidence beyond the source card.

## Pattern: Responsive Composition Review
Use when a section has multiple cards, supporting modules, or a board-like layout.

Rules:
1. Rebalance composition for tablet and desktop instead of stretching the mobile stack.
2. One oversized summary slab plus several small fragments is usually a hierarchy failure.
3. Check symmetry, scan path, and evidence density before adding more cards or more copy.
4. Remove repeated headers, repeated helper text, and repeated framing chrome before polishing visuals.

## Pattern: Persona Copy
Use plain-language labels on persona-facing surfaces. Internal architecture terms stay in developer-only routes and docs.

Rules:
1. Do not surface abbreviations such as `PKM` in consumer-facing profile, privacy, or settings copy.
2. Prefer descriptive labels such as `Personal Data` when the surface is user-facing.
3. Developer-only routes such as `PKM Agent Lab` may keep internal product terms when the audience is explicitly technical.

## Pattern: Signed-In Route Dogfooding
Use the route-contract Playwright sweep for signed-in route families.

```bash
cd hushh-webapp
npm run verify:routes
```

Rules:
1. The route contract in `lib/navigation/app-route-layout.contract.json` is the browser coverage source of truth.
2. Do not reach for Playwright when unit, integration, service, or Next runtime diagnostics can prove the behavior more cheaply.
3. Use the sweep when the proof requires a real browser:
   auth/bootstrap, vault unlock, Next navigation, responsive layout, animation, or browser-only interaction.
4. The sweep must use the real reviewer login and vault unlock path when the route family is signed-in.
5. Same-session proof must use in-app Next client navigation after unlock; direct `page.goto(...)` is cold-entry proof, not same-session proof.
6. Route-specific one-off scripts are for debugging; they do not replace the contract-driven sweep.

## Pattern: Stock Chart Primitives
Use stock chart infrastructure for all chart surfaces.

```tsx
import {
  ChartContainer,
  ChartTooltip,
  ChartTooltipContent,
  ChartLegend,
  ChartLegendContent,
} from "@/components/ui/chart";
```

Rules:
1. Keep tooltip formatting inside `ChartTooltipContent` formatter/labelFormatter.
2. Keep chart files focused on data mapping and composition.
3. Avoid chart primitive forks outside `components/ui/chart.tsx`.

## Pattern: Moved App UI Components
Custom app components now live in `components/app-ui/*`.

```tsx
import { HushhLoader } from "@/components/app-ui/hushh-loader";
import { TopAppBar } from "@/components/app-ui/top-app-bar";
```

Do not use:
1. `@/components/ui/hushh-loader`
2. `@/components/ui/top-app-bar`
3. `@/components/ui/data-table`

## Pattern: Toast Usage
Use Morphy toast helper for app notifications.

```tsx
import { morphyToast } from "@/lib/morphy-ux/morphy";

morphyToast.success("Saved");
```

## Pattern: Icon Usage
Use Lucide through the icon wrapper for consistent sizing behavior.

```tsx
import { Shield } from "lucide-react";
import { Icon } from "@/lib/morphy-ux/ui";

<Icon icon={Shield} size="sm" className="text-primary" />;
```

## Pattern: Actionable Surface Rows
Use `SettingsRow` for clickable list rows across the app, not only on Profile.

```tsx
import { SettingsRow } from "@/components/profile/settings-ui";

<SettingsRow
  leading={<span className="inline-flex h-10 w-10 items-center justify-center rounded-2xl">AAPL</span>}
  title="Apple"
  description="AAPL • Technology • BUY"
  trailing="$214.75"
  chevron
  onClick={() => openDetail()}
/>;
```

Rules:
1. The whole row owns hover, press, and ripple.
2. Inner text blocks must not create a second hover state.
3. Use `asChild` for link rows so anchors inherit the same interaction contract.
