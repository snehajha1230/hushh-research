```

## Purpose

Use `docs/future/` for:

- future-state architecture concepts
- R&D risk assessments
- architecture options and dependency maps
- promotion criteria before execution starts

Do not use this home for:

- durable product thesis
- current implementation contracts
- package-local technical references

## Boundary Model

| Layer | Purpose | Home |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vision | durable north stars and product thesis | `docs/vision/` |
| Future roadmap | planning-only future-state concepts and R&D assessment | `docs/future/` |
| Execution | active implementation contracts and package docs | `docs/reference/`, `consent-protocol/docs/`, `hushh-webapp/docs/` |

## Promotion Rule

A document may move out of `docs/future/` only when:

1. the concept is approved for execution
2. the execution owner is known
3. the implementation surfaces are known
4. the content can be split into execution-owned docs instead of remaining a speculative concept note

Promotion targets:

- cross-cutting execution contracts -> `docs/reference/...`
- backend execution docs -> `consent-protocol/docs/...`
- frontend/product execution docs -> `hushh-webapp/docs/...`
