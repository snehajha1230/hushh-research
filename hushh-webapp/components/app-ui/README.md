# App UI North Star

This folder is the canonical home for signed-in shell primitives and shared page chrome.

## Start Here

- `app-page-shell.tsx`: page root, header region, and content region contract.
- `page-sections.tsx`: `PageHeader` and `SectionHeader`.
- `surfaces.tsx`: shared surface/card wrappers and `SurfaceStack`.
- `top-app-bar.tsx`: top chrome, persona switcher, and bell trigger.
- `debate-task-center.tsx`: notification bell surface with pinned consent-center launcher.

## Rules

1. Top-level page layout belongs here, not inside route files.
2. Shared headers and shared surfaces are the market-route reference implementation.
3. New shell behavior must update `docs/reference/quality/README.md` and `app-surface-design-system.md`.
