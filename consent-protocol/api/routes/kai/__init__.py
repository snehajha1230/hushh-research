Agent Kai API Routes — Modular Package

This package organizes Kai routes into logical modules:
- chat.py: Conversational chat endpoint with auto-learning
- portfolio.py: Portfolio import and analysis
- analyze.py: Non-streaming analysis endpoint
- stream.py: SSE streaming analysis endpoint
- decisions.py: Decision history (reads from domain_summaries; legacy CRUD returns 410)
- consent.py: Kai-specific consent grants

All sub-routers are aggregated into `kai_router` for backward compatibility.
