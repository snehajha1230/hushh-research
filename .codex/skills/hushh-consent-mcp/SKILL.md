# Hushh Consent MCP Skill

## Purpose and Trigger

- Primary scope: `hushh-consent-mcp-ops`
- Trigger on direct connector tasks against the Hushh Consent MCP surface:
  - `discover_user_domains`
  - `request_consent`
  - `check_consent_status`
  - `validate_token`
  - `get_encrypted_scoped_export`
- Use this when the question is about what the connector returns right now, not when changing backend consent logic.
- Avoid overlap with `backend`, `mcp-developer-surface`, and `security-audit`.

## Coverage and Ownership

- Role: `spoke`
- Owner family: `backend`

Owned repo surfaces:

1. `packages/hushh-mcp`
2. `consent-protocol/docs/mcp-setup.md`
3. `.codex/skills/hushh-consent-mcp`

Non-owned surfaces:

1. `backend`
2. `security-audit`
3. `docs-governance`

## Do Use

1. Verifying whether a specific user resolves to any discoverable domains/scopes.
2. Comparing prod vs UAT connector behavior for the same identifier.
3. Debugging connector startup/config mismatches across Codex, Claude Desktop, or other MCP hosts.
4. Verifying whether a missing result is a connector/config issue versus an actual empty discovery response.

## Do Not Use

1. Changing consent scope semantics or IAM policy.
2. Broad backend runtime work outside the MCP connector.
3. UI-only consent surface work.

## Read First

1. `packages/hushh-mcp/README.md`
2. `consent-protocol/docs/mcp-setup.md`
3. `docs/reference/operations/coding-agent-mcp.md`

## Workflow

1. Verify the local host config first if the issue smells like a connector startup failure.
2. When discovery returns no domains, check at least two environments when available before concluding it is a user-data issue.
3. Distinguish clearly between:
   - connector failed to start
   - connector connected but returned an empty discovery result
   - environment mismatch between local, UAT, and production
4. Default discovery should stay compact: domains plus top-level requestable scopes. Deep leaf-path scope expansion is debug-only.
5. When auditing PKM parity, compare connector output to the backend metadata route and manifest-backed domain truth for the same user before concluding discovery is wrong.
6. Report the raw connector result concisely before inferring causes.
7. If the connector returns empty in multiple environments, treat that as a valid empty response until proven otherwise.

## Handoff Rules

1. If the request is still broad or ambiguous, route it back to `backend`.
2. If the task becomes package/docs evolution, hand off to `mcp-developer-surface`.
3. If the task becomes consent-policy or trust-boundary analysis, hand off to `security-audit`.
4. If the task becomes backend API contract work, hand off to `backend-api-contracts`.

## Required Checks

```bash
python3 .codex/skills/codex-skill-authoring/scripts/skill_lint.py
./bin/hushh codex audit
cd packages/hushh-mcp && npm run print-config
```
